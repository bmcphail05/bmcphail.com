abstract = "In the debates about secularization in modern societies, proponents have touted the decline of religion in Europe while critics have pointed to the persistence of religion in the United States. Where does East Asia fit in? East Asia not only has about 30 percent of the world's population but also has undergone rapid modernization in recent decades. Is religion in East Asia more like Europe and characterized by a trajectory of decline, or is it more like the United States and characterized by relative stability? Using a variety of available survey and census data, we analyze religious trends in the societies of China, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Preliminary results are mixed. Although there are appearances of decreasing levels of religiosity across generations, there are also indicators of stability over the past few decades. Our analyses reveal patterns that are not consistent with those found in other highly developed nations and that further complicate our understanding of religion in modern societies. Given the limitations of available data and the mixed evidence, we cannot yet conclude that overall trends of religion in East Asia are distinctly different from either Europe or the United States. This highlights the need for more research and for surveys that better measure religiosity in East Asian populations."
