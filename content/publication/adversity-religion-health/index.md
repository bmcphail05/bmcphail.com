abstract = "This study examines whether religion buffers the deleterious effects of childhood abuse on adult sleep quality. Using cross-sectional data from the Midlife in the United States Study (MIDUS I), I estimated logistic regression models to test whether three measures of religiosity (*N* = 2,644)--weekly religious attendance, religious salience, and spirituality--moderate the accumulated impact of emotional, physical, and severe physical childhood abuse on chronic sleep problems. Weekly religious attendance significantly buffers the effect of having 1-2 types of abuse during childhood--but not the effect of having all three types of abuse--on adult sleep quality. In contrast, religious salience and spirituality do not have a moderating influence on associations between experiencing childhood abuse and chronic sleep problems in adulthood. More broadly, these findings support assertions that religious involvement and the psychosocial resources it provides can buffer the later life health consequences of childhood misfortune."
