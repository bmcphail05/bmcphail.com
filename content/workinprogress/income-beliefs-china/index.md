abstract = "This study examines the differences in beliefs about divine concern and involvement across levels of socioeconomic status as measured by income, education, and occupational prestige. Using data from the 2007 Spiritual Life Survey of Chinese Residents, I find the following: (1) Neither education or occupation are associated with beliefs about divine involvement or concern at the personal or social level. However, individuals with higher income levels are more likely to believe that God/gods are involved in and concerned with their personal affairs. This association is stronger for individuals that pray more. These results contrast considerably with similar studies in the United States which find an overall negative association between SES and beliefs about divine concern and involvement and an overall positive association between religious activity and beliefs about divine concern and involvement."
