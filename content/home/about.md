# About me

I am a PhD student in sociology at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. My research interests include religion, family, intergenerational relationships, public attitudes, religious contexts, East Asia, and quantitative methods.

I am currently a research assistant at the [Center on Religion and Chinese Society](http://purdue.edu/crcs) and an editorial assistant for the [*Review of Religion and Chinese Society*](http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/22143955).
