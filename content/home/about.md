I earned my PhD in sociology at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. My research interests include religion, family, health, religious ecology, and East Asia.

I am currently a graduate student instructor in the [Purdue Sociology Department](https://www.cla.purdue.edu/sociology/), a research assistant at the [Center on Religion and the Global East](http://www.globaleast.org/), and an editorial assistant for the [*Review of Religion and Chinese Society*](http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/22143955).
